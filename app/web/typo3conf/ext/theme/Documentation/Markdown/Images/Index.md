# Handling of Images in TYPO3

This TYPO3 distribution tries to help you as much with image handling in
different situations:

1. [Resize/Process images on upload](#resizeprocess-images-on-upload)
2. [Simplified cropVariants configuration](#simplified-cropvariants-configuration-for-the-table-configuration-array)
   (custom CropVariantsBuilder)

3. [Centralized configuration for AspectRatio, Cover-/Crop-/FocusArea presets and CropVariant definitions](#centralized-configuration-for-aspectratio-cover-crop-focusarea-presets-and-cropvariant-definitions)
4. [Unlocalize crop configuration](#unlocalize-crop-configuration)

## Resize/Process images on upload

With the help of Xavier's `EXT:image_autoresize` it's possible to
process images while uploading in the TYPO3 backend. At time of writing
this documentation, the extension supports following features:

* Resize images on upload (based on maxWidth, maxHeight or maxFilesize,
  fileTypes)
* Rotate images on upload (based on image orientation)
* Remove/Keep image metadata on upload
* Convert image format on upload via mapping
* All the features can be limited to specific directories

You found a predefined extConf in
`typo3conf/AdditionalConfiguration.php` and all further configuration
details inside the extension (documentation, files, configuration in
TYPO3 backend).

## Simplified cropVariants configuration for the Table Configuration Array

TYPO3 has some really powerful features to allow TYPO3 backend editors
to crop images. You have the following possibilities to configure
cropVariants for a field in following contexts (as far as I know and
I've use in real world TYPO3 projects):

### Primary usage scenarios

1. Set a *global/default* cropVariants configuration (which is used if
   you do not make a more specific configuration)
2. Set a cropVariants configuration for a *specific field of a specific
   table* (where you optionally can disable the default/global
   cropVariants configuration)
3. Set a cropVariants configuration for a *specific field of a specific
   type of a table* (where you optionally can disable the default/global
   cropVariants configuration)

**I know that may seem confusing - but once you understand, how the
options are working, it makes sense for real world scenarios.**

### Additional usage scenarios

1. Set a cropVariants configuration for a *specific field childTca's
   type of a specific table* (where you optionally can disable (parts
   of) the default/global cropVariants configuration) - as used in IRRE
   elements for example.
2. Set a cropVariants configuration for a *specific field childTca's
   type of a specific type of a table* (where you optionally can disable
   (parts of) the default/global cropVariants configuration) - as used
   in IRRE elements for example.

### And what exactly simplifies this TYPO3 distribution?

#### I Configure all your cropVariants in a YAML file:

**a)** You can set up defaults (presets)
* for aspectRatio,
* for coverArea,
* for cropArea,
* for focusArea.

**b)** You can define all default cropVariants based on your defaults.

**c)** You can define cropVariants for specific columns (pages.media)

**d)** You can define cropVariants for specific columns of specific
types (tt_content.image for specific CType textpic)

#### II Or configure all or some of your cropVariants via TCA/Overrides and IDE autocompletion support

[A custom CropVariants Builder](CropVariantsBuilder.md) helps you
writing cropVariants configurations based on mentioned defaults with IDE
auto completion support.

> All the defaults in the YAML file can be used â€“ even if you don't use
> the CropVariants Builder and write only plain PHP TCA configuration
> for your project.

#### III Last but not least: Write plain TCA configuration for your cropVariants

You can still access the defaults. This allows you to still manage the standards centrally.

## Centralized configuration for AspectRatio, Cover-/Crop-/FocusArea presets and CropVariant definitions

All listed defaults/presets can be actually configured in one YAML file.

[**Overview of defaults and predefined presets**](DefaultsAndPresets.md)

1. [aspectRatio presets](DefaultsAndPresets.md#predefined-aspectratios)
2. [coverArea presets](DefaultsAndPresets.md#predefined-coverareas)
3. [cropArea presets](DefaultsAndPresets.md#predefined-cropareas)
4. [List of default cropVariants](DefaultsAndPresets.md#list-of-default-cropvariants)

---

## Unlocalize crop configuration

Unlocalize `sys_file_reference.crop` per default. Most of the time, this
is what I need for translated websites.

**Just run `composer uninstall cmsexperts/unlocalizedcrop` if you want
to remove this behaviour and activate TYPO3 Core's default.**

---

## Image Only File Collection

A static file collection type which only supports supported image file
types makes working with file collections much easier.

## Frontend Image Rendering
