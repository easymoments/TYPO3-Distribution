# Page Module Enhancements

## Custom CSS file

If you build extra ordinary cool backend previews for you content
elements it's often necessary to add custom css styles.

A custom css file
([PageLayoutView.css](../../../Resources/Public/Css/Backend/PageLayoutView.css))
with the usage of the `drawHeaderHook` hook is therefore automatically
included. **Edit the file to your needs!**

> **Tipp:** Prefix your css classes to avoid conflicts with the TYPO3
> Core's default CSS.
