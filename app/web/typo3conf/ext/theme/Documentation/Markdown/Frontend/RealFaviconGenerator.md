# Gulp powered RealFaviconGenerator.net

* Install dependencies `cd ./app/web/typo3conf/ext/theme/Build && npm install`
* Replace dummy favicon with your Favicon `./app/web/typo3conf/ext/theme/Resources/Public/Icons/Favicon/FaviconMaster.svg`
* Configure the task in the gulpfile.js `./app/web/typo3conf/ext/theme/Build/gulpfile.js` ([details and instructions](https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon/gulp))
* Generate/Update favicon `cd ./app/web/typo3conf/ext/theme/Build && gulp generate-favicon`
* Inject favicon markup `cd ./app/web/typo3conf/ext/theme/Build && gulp inject-favicon-markups`

As the favicon doesn't change often and generation takes some seconds, all the generated files are included in git
repository and could be deployed as-is. The reasons why the favicons are saved in document root are described
[in the realfavicongenerator.net faq section](https://realfavicongenerator.net/faq).
